# This is a test case project for the Wibesoft Company

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Install Packages

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn add
```

## Step 2: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator shortly provided you have set up your emulator correctly

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio .

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
